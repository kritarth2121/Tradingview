title (const string) The title of the script. It is displayed on the chart when no `shorttitle` argument is used, and becomes the publication's default title when publishing the script.
shorttitle (const string) The script's display name on charts. If specified, it will replace the `title` argument in most chart-related windows. Optional. The default is the argument used for `title`.
overlay (const bool) If true, the strategy will be displayed over the chart. If false, it will be added in a separate pane. Strategy-specific labels that display entries and exits will be displayed over the main chart regardless of this setting. Optional. The default is false.
format (const string) Specifies the formatting of the script's displayed values. Possible values: format.inherit, format.price, format.volume, format.percent. Optional. The default is format.inherit.
precision (const int) Specifies the number of digits after the floating point of the script's displayed values. Must be a non-negative integer no greater than 16. If `format` is set to format.inherit and `precision` is specified, the format will instead be set to format.price. Optional. The default is inherited from the precision of the chart's symbol.
scale (scale_type) The price scale used. Possible values: scale.right, scale.left, scale.none. The scale.none value can only be applied in combination with `overlay = true`. Optional. By default, the script uses the same scale as the chart.
pyramiding (const int) The maximum number of entries allowed in the same direction. If the value is 0, only one entry order in the same direction can be opened, and additional entry orders are rejected. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0.
calc_on_order_fills (const bool) Specifies whether the strategy should be recalculated after an order is filled. If true, the strategy recalculates after an order is filled, as opposed to recalculating only when the bar closes. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is false.
calc_on_every_tick (const bool) Specifies whether the strategy should be recalculated on each realtime tick. If true, when the strategy is running on a realtime bar, it will recalculate on each chart update. If false, the strategy only calculates when the realtime bar closes. The argument used does not affect strategy calculation on historical data. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is false.
max_bars_back (const int) The length of the historical buffer the script keeps for every variable and function, which determines how many past values can be referenced using the `[]` history-referencing operator. The required buffer size is automatically detected by the Pine Scriptâ„¢ runtime. Using this parameter is only necessary when a runtime error occurs because automatic detection fails. More information on the underlying mechanics of the historical buffer can be found in our Help Center. Optional. The default is 0.
backtest_fill_limits_assumption (const int) Limit order execution threshold in ticks. When it is used, limit orders are only filled if the market price exceeds the order's limit level by the specified number of ticks. Optional. The default is 0.
default_qty_type (const string) Specifies the units used for `default_qty_value`. Possible values are: strategy.fixed for contracts/shares/lots, strategy.cash for currency amounts, or strategy.percent_of_equity for a percentage of available equity. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is strategy.fixed.
default_qty_value (const int/float) The default quantity to trade, in units determined by the argument used with the `default_qty_type` parameter. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 1.
initial_capital (const int/float) The amount of funds initially available for the strategy to trade, in units of `currency`. Optional. The default is 1000000.
currency (const string) Currency used by the strategy in currency-related calculations. Market positions are still opened by converting `currency` into the chart symbol's currency. The conversion rates used are based on the FX_IDC pairs' daily rates of the previous day (relative to the bar where the calculation is done). This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is currency.NONE, in which case the chart's currency is used. Possible values: one of the constants in the `currency.*` namespace, e.g. currency.USD.
slippage (const int) Slippage expressed in ticks. This value is added to or subtracted from the fill price of market/stop orders to make the fill price less favorable for the strategy. E.g., if syminfo.mintick is 0.01 and `slippage` is set to 5, a long market order will enter at 5 * 0.01 = 0.05 points above the actual price. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0.
commission_type (const string) Determines what the number passed to the `commission_value` expresses: strategy.commission.percent for a percentage of the cash volume of the order, strategy.commission.cash_per_contract for currency per contract, strategy.commission.cash_per_order for currency per order. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is strategy.commission.percent.
commission_value (const int/float) Commission applied to the strategy's orders in units determined by the argument passed to the `commission_type` parameter. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0.
process_orders_on_close (const bool) When set to true, generates an additional attempt to execute orders after a bar closes and strategy calculations are completed. If the orders are market orders, the broker emulator executes them before the next bar's open. If the orders are price-dependent, they will only be filled if the price conditions are met. This option is useful if you wish to close positions on the current bar. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is false.
close_entries_rule (const string) Determines the order in which trades are closed. Possible values are: "FIFO" (First-In, First-Out) if the earliest exit order must close the earliest entry order, or "ANY" if the orders are closed based on the `from_entry` parameter of the strategy.exit function. "FIFO" can only be used with stocks, futures and US forex (NFA Compliance Rule 2-43b), while "ANY" is allowed in non-US forex. Optional. The default is "FIFO".
margin_long (const int/float) Margin long is the percentage of the purchase price of a security that must be covered by cash or collateral for long positions. Must be a non-negative number. The logic used to simulate margin calls is explained in the Help Center. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0, in which case the strategy does not enforce any limits on position size.
margin_short (const int/float) Margin short is the percentage of the purchase price of a security that must be covered by cash or collateral for short positions. Must be a non-negative number. The logic used to simulate margin calls is explained in the Help Center. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0, in which case the strategy does not enforce any limits on position size.
explicit_plot_zorder (const bool) Specifies the order in which the script's plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, plots are drawn in the order in which they appear in the script's code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous ones. This only applies to `plot*()` functions, fill, and hline. Optional. The default is false.
max_lines_count (const int) The number of last line drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. Optional. The default is 50.
max_labels_count (const int) The number of last label drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. Optional. The default is 50.
max_boxes_count (const int) The number of last box drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. Optional. The default is 50.
risk_free_rate (const int/float) The risk-free rate of return is the annual percentage change in the value of an investment with minimal or zero risk. It is used to calculate the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. Optional. The default is 2.
use_bar_magnifier (const bool) When true, the Broker Emulator uses lower timeframe data during history backtesting to achieve more realistic results. Optional. The default is false. Only Premium accounts have access to this feature.
